<p><ind>After graduation I am going to be taking the LSAT in June and then starting to work as an IT consultant for <b>PricewaterhouseCoopers</b> in <i>Chicago</i> in August.  In between June and August, one of my goals is to go to Rio to watch the World Cup and then to travel through Brazil, Argentina Ecuador and Chile.  I hope to work for PwC for 12 to 18 months.  After that I plan to attend <u>law school</u> and earn a JD/MBA from either the University of Michigan, Boston University or a law school in California.  At this point I think I'd study patent law given my tech background. </p>
